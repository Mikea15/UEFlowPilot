### Description

<Image src={schema} alt="UFlowPilotTask Schema" />

`UFlowPilotTask` is the base class for all Tasks that can run in FlowPilot.

The schema above shows succintely how it works.

Each Tasks starts its execution by calling their `Enter()` methods. They can either succeed or fail at this stage.
Upon failing, the task ends. If succeeded, `Tick` is then called and we check the Task Result ( InProgress, Succeeded, Failed, Error ).
If the Task returns `Succeeded` the `Exit()` method is called.

Tasks can also be cancelled, and end directly.

Each class that can be implemented need to override a couple of virtual methods exposed by this task, either in Cpp or implementing the Blueprint versions when creating a `UFlowPilotTask` via blueprint.

### Interface

```cpp
// UFlowPilotTask
// Setups Tasks. Called once per FlowPilotExecution, even after restarts.
virtual void Setup(FFlowContext* InContext);
// Called when starting this Task. Returns true on success
virtual bool Enter();
// Called on Tick. Will success automatically if not implemented by Child classes
virtual EFPTaskResult Tick(float DeltaTime);
// Called when Tick returns Succeeds
virtual void Exit();
// Resets all Tasks into their Setup States
virtual void Reset();

#if WITH_EDITOR
	// Returns true if valid. Child Tasks should implement their Validations
	virtual bool IsTaskDataValid(FDataValidationContext& InContext) { return true; }
#endif

#if !UE_BUILD_SHIPPING && !UE_BUILD_TEST
	// Gathers information to display to debug view about Task.
	virtual void GetRuntimeDescription(TArray<FString>& OutLines) const {};
#endif
