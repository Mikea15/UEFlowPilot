## Description

import LinkRef from '../../../components/LinkRef.astro'; 

This page lists the Enums used in FlowPilot.

### `EFPStopType`

Used when passed by parameter to a stop running request.
```cpp
UENUM()
enum class EFPStopType : uint8
{
	// Normal Stop/Cancellation Flow
	Normal,
	// Force Stop Execution
	Force
};
```


### `EFPTaskResult`

Used to describe `UFlowPilotTask` execution state.

```cpp
UENUM(BlueprintType)
enum class EFPTaskResult : uint8
{
	// Not started yet
	None,
	// In progress and Ticking
	InProgress,
	// Complete with Success Result
	Succeeded,
	// Complete with Fail Result
	Failed,
	// Not Complete. Return Error
	Error
};
```

### `EFPFlowState`

Used to describe `UFlowPilot` execution state.

```cpp
UENUM()
enum class EFlowState : uint8
{
	// Not started yet
	None,
	// FlowPilot Running
	InProgress,
	// FlowPilot has started but is paused
	Paused,
	// FlowPilot Done with Success
	Succeeded,
	// FlowPilot Done with fail
	Failed,
	// FlowPilot not Done, with Error
	Error
};
```

### `EFlowActorSpawnLifetime`

```cpp
UENUM()
enum class EFlowActorSpawnLifetime : uint8
{
	// Spawned actor will live during FlowPilot Execution, will despawn automatically when Flow Ends.
	FlowPilot,

	// Spawned actors will stay on the level event when Flow Stops.
	Persistent
};
```

### `EFlowActorScope`

Used with <LinkRef c="FFlowActorReference" />

```cpp
UENUM()
enum class EFlowActorScope : uint8
{
	// Actor or Component is in Own Actor
	Self,

	// Actor that live in the world
	InLevel,
	
	// Actors spawned at Runtime
	Runtime,
};
```

### `EFlowMode`

Used by `UFlowPilotComponent` to control `UFlowPilot` execution mode.

```cpp
UENUM()
enum class EFlowMode : uint8
{
	// Executes Flow Once.
	RunOnce,

	// Executes until Succeeds Once
	RunUntilSucceed,

	// Executes until Fails Once
	RunUntilFail,

	// Executes in Loop while Succeeds
	RunWhileSucceed,

	// Executes in Loop while Fails
	RunWhileFail,

	// Run non stop.
	RunNonStop
};
```
