`UFPTask_Parallel` is a Task that can run multiple tasks at the same time (in parallel).

There are various _Completion types_ for this task:

- Any Succeed: `UFPTask_Parallel` will succeed at the first Children Task that succeeds. It won't wait for all tasks to be complete. Otherwise fail.
- All Succeed: `UFPTask_Parallel` will wait for all Child Task's results, and if they all succeeded, then `UFPTask_Parallel` succeeds. Otherwise fail.
- Any Fail: `UFPTask_Parallel` will succeed at the first Children Task failure. It won't wait for all tasks to be complete. Otherwise fail.
- All Fail: `UFPTask_Parallel` will wait for all Child Task's results and if they all failed, then `UFPTask_Parallel` succeeds. Otherwise fail.
