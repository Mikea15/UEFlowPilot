## `UFlowPilot`

[ `UDataAsset` ]

 
- Defines FlowName 
- Defines Root Sequence 
By default, all FlowPilot Assets are Sequences which is a good enough point to start your flow. 
if the need arises, we can potentially add an option to switch to a selector by default 
for now, if you want a selector first, you can add it as the first child of the sequence, that will work just as well. 

### Properties

```cpp
// Flow Id 
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category = "FlowPilot")
FName FlowName = "Flow Name";

// Main Flow sequence. 
UPROPERTY(meta=(DeprecatedProperty))
TArray<TObjectPtr<UFlowPilotTask>> MainFlow_DEPRECATED;

```
