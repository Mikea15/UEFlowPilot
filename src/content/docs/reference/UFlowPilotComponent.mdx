### Description

<Image src={schema} alt="UFlowPilotComponent Schema" />

`UFlowPilotComponent` is the base component required to run FlowPilot. It takes a <LinkRef c="UFlowPilot" /> Asset, instances it and runs it.
Most of its methods are exposed to blueprint to allow quick iteration.

`UFlowPilotComponent` also has custom _ExecutionModes_ which can be:
- RunOnce: Runs flow once, wether it succeed or fails
- RunUntilSucceed: Runs flow until it succeeds, then stops 
- RunUntilFail: Runs flow until it fails, then stops
- RunWhileSucceed: Runs flow while it succeed. Will stop on failure.
- RunWhileFail: Runs flow while it fails. Will stop on success
- RunNonStop: Runs flow over and over.

There's a _RetryDelay_ to help control how fast should a retry occur.

The Root Task of <LinkRef c="UFlowPilot" /> is a <LinkRef c="UFPTask_Sequence" />, therefore, the execution of `UFlowPilotComponent` is a sequence.
