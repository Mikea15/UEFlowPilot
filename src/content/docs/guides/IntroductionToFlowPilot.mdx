Welcome! You're in the right place if you're just starting out. I'll try to be as simple as I can.
Let's dive in!

## Prep work

I'm starting this tutorial with a mostly empty level, you won't need much more than that. 
I have a basic AI that doesn't have a behavior and a couple of blocks, and triggers in the level.

In this guide, we're going to be:

- [ ] Creating a FlowPilot Asset
- [ ] Add a FlowPilotComponent to either a Level Blueprint or Actor in the Level
- [ ] Edit FlowPilot Asset to have a couple of AI spawn when the Player enters a trigger
- [ ] Bonus: Discuss FlowActorReference, Tags and Groups
- [ ] Bonus: Discuss SpawnLifetime and FlowPilot Execution Modes

## Tutorial 

### Creating a FlowPilot Asset

<Steps>
1. Flow Pilot Asset is found in `Miscellaneous > Data Asset`
    <Image src={data_asset_menu} alt="Data Asset Menu" />

2. Search for FlowPilot
    <Image src={select_flowpilot} alt="Select FlowPilot" />

3. Save the Asset. I'll name mine `FP_Tutorial`.
    <Image src={tutorial_asset} alt="Tutorial Asset" />
    <Aside>Note that saving the asset will show a warning! This is normal. Data Validation is there to catch when a FlowPilot is not correctly setup.</Aside>
</Steps>

### Adding a `FlowPilotComponent` to an Actor

We can now add a `FlowPilotComponent` to an Actor (you could do this to any Level Blueprint or Actor Blueprint as well.)

<Steps>

1. Create any Empty Actor in the Level and add a `FlowPilotComponent` to it.
    <Image src={add_flowpilot_comp} alt="Add FlowPilotComponent Component to Actor" />

1. Selecting the newly created component we can now reference the asset `FP_Tutorial` we have previously created.
    <Image src={link_fp_asset} alt="Link FlowPilot Asset" />
    
2. Check `Auto Start on Begin Play` to start FlowPilot when we start the game. 

3. Execution Mode handles how FlowPilot Runs, and what happens on Success or Failure. For now, we can leave it as `Run Once`.

</Steps>

At this point, you have successfully created a new FlowPilot asset and have an actor that can run the Flow! AMAZING!
Lets edit FlowPilot and start seeing it in action!

### Editing Flow

import tutorial_editor_view from '../../../assets/tutorial_editor_view.png';
import add_spawn_task from '../../../assets/add_spawn_task.png';
import spawn_class_details from '../../../assets/spawn_class_details.png';

<Steps>

1. Open `FP_Tutorial`. You'll see an editor with 3 panels. 
The left one is a full view of the asset, the middle one shows you the FlowTree and the right panel displays details when a Task is selected from the Tree. 
    <Image src={tutorial_editor_view} alt="Tutorial Editor View" />

2. Click on `Root Sequence` and then either `Right Click -> Add Task` or `Add` Button on the Toolbar. This will create a `FPTask_Sequence` by default.
With `Root Sequence` still selected, head over to the Details Tab and change the class for `Index[0]` to `Gameplay | Spawn Class`.
    <Image src={add_spawn_task} alt="Add Spawn Class" />

3. Select `Spawn Class` from the TreeView, and lets examine what we can do on the Details Tab.
    <Image src={spawn_class_details} alt="Spawn Class Details" />

4. I'm going to select my AI for property `Spawn Class`. Feel free to use any class/actor/bp you'd like

5. Save, and Run the game. Lets see what that does.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Nothing happened?">It seems like nothing happened! Strange! Fear not, lets find out</Aside>

I'm going to make a few changes to the MainFlow.

<Steps>

1. Open `FP_Tutorial`

2. Select `Spawn Class` from the TreeView.

4. Change Property `ActorSpawnLifetime` from `FlowPilot` to `Persistent`

5. Save, and Run the game.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Much Success!">
We now have an Actor spawned at the location of our `FlowPilotComponent`'s own Actor Location!

Changing the Spawn Lifetime, meant that depending on which kind of Lifetime you want, FlowPilot can automatically destroy what was spawned (i.e. `FlowPilot` lifetime) when its execution ends, 
or leave them in the level (i.e. `Persistent` lifetime)
</Aside>
