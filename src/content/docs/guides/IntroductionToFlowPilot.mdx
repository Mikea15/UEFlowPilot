Welcome! You're in the right place if you're just starting out. I'll try to be as simple as I can.
Let's dive in!

## Prep work

I'm starting this tutorial with a mostly empty level, you won't need much more than that. 
I have a basic AI that doesn't have a behavior and a couple of blocks, and triggers in the level.

## Tutorial 

### Creating a FlowPilot Asset

import data_asset_menu from '../../../assets/misc-data-asset.png';
import select_flowpilot from '../../../assets/select-flowpilot.png';
import tutorial_asset from '../../../assets/fp-tutorial-asset.png';
import add_flowpilot_comp from '../../../assets/fp-add-new-component.png';
import link_fp_asset from '../../../assets/link_fp_asset.png';

<Steps>
1. Flow Pilot Asset is found in `Miscellaneous > Data Asset`
    <Image src={data_asset_menu} alt="Data Asset Menu" />

2. Search for FlowPilot
    <Image src={select_flowpilot} alt="Select FlowPilot" />

3. Save the Asset. I'll name mine `FP_Tutorial`.
    <Image src={tutorial_asset} alt="Tutorial Asset" />
    <Aside>Note that saving the asset will show a warning! This is normal. Data Validation is there to catch when a FlowPilot is not correctly setup.</Aside>
</Steps>

### Adding a FlowPilotComponent to an Actor in the Level

We can now add a <LinkRef c="UFlowPilotComponent" /> to an Actor (you could do this to any Level Blueprint or Actor Blueprint as well.)

<Steps>

1. Create any Empty Actor in the Level and add a <LinkRef c="UFlowPilotComponent" /> to it.
    <Image src={add_flowpilot_comp} alt="Add FlowPilotComponent Component to Actor" />

1. Selecting the newly created component we can now reference the asset `FP_Tutorial` we have previously created.
    <Image src={link_fp_asset} alt="Link FlowPilot Asset" />
    
2. Check `Auto Start on Begin Play` to start FlowPilot when we start the game. 

3. Execution Mode handles how FlowPilot Runs, and what happens on Success or Failure. For now, we can leave it as `Run Once`.

</Steps>

At this point, you have successfully created a new FlowPilot asset and have an actor that can run the Flow! AMAZING!
Lets edit FlowPilot and start seeing it in action!

### Editing Flow

import tutorial_editor_view from '../../../assets/tutorial_editor_view.png';
import add_spawn_task from '../../../assets/add_spawn_task.png';
import spawn_class_details from '../../../assets/spawn_class_details.png';

<Steps>

1. Open `FP_Tutorial`. You'll see an editor with 3 panels. 
The left one is a full view of the asset, the middle one shows you the FlowTree and the right panel displays details when a Task is selected from the Tree. 
    <Image src={tutorial_editor_view} alt="Tutorial Editor View" />

2. Click on `Root Sequence` and then either `Right Click -> Add Task` or `Add` Button on the Toolbar. This will create a `FPTask_Sequence` by default.
With `Root Sequence` still selected, head over to the Details Tab and change the class for `Index[0]` to `Gameplay | Spawn Class`.
    <Image src={add_spawn_task} alt="Add Spawn Class" />

3. Select `Spawn Class` from the TreeView, and lets examine what we can do on the Details Tab.
    <Image src={spawn_class_details} alt="Spawn Class Details" />

4. I'm going to select my AI for property `Spawn Class`. Feel free to use any class/actor/bp you'd like

5. Save, and Run the game. Lets see what that does.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Nothing happened?">It seems like nothing happened! Strange! Fear not, lets find out</Aside>

I'm going to make a few changes to the MainFlow.

<Steps>

1. Go back to `FP_Tutorial` and select `Spawn Class` task

2. Change Property `ActorSpawnLifetime` from `FlowPilot` to `Persistent`

3. Save, and Run the game.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Much Success!">
We now have an Actor spawned at the location of our <LinkRef c="UFlowPilotComponent" />'s own Actor Location!

Changing the Spawn Lifetime, meant that depending on which kind of Lifetime you want, FlowPilot can automatically destroy what was spawned (i.e. `FlowPilot` lifetime) when its execution ends, 
or leave them in the level (i.e. `Persistent` lifetime)
</Aside>

### Change Spawn Location

import reference_spawn from '../../../assets/reference_spawn.png';
import runtime_tags from '../../../assets/runtime_tags.png';


Right now, the AI we're spawning is using the Actor where <LinkRef c="UFlowPilotComponent" /> was added, as the source location.
This is done with the Property `Spawn Location Reference`. This property is a custom type called <LinkRef c="FFlowActorReference" />.

You can read more about <LinkRef c="FFlowActorReference" />

Lets now change where we spawn the AI.

<Steps>
1. Go back to `FP_Tutorial` and select `Spawn Class` task

2. In the details panel, change `Spawn Location Reference` `Scope` from `Self` to `In Level`

3. Lets create a new Actor in the level, and reference that in `Level Actor`
    <Image src={reference_spawn} alt="Reference Spawn Actor" />

4. Save and Run.

</Steps>

You should now see the Actor spawn at the new location.

There's a third `Scope` option for <LinkRef c="FFlowActorReference" /> which is `Runtime`.
Runtime means the actor we want to find and use is not yet in the level. This is every actor that is spawned during gameplay, therefor at `Runtime`.
The way FlowPilot handles this is using `GameplayTags`. `FlowPilot` uses `GameplayTags` to easily find single, or groups of actors that have the tag.

<Image src={runtime_tags} alt="Referente by GameplayTag" />

I'll leave this one for you as a task.

Add a Tag to any Actor in your level, and reference it. Does your actor spawn at that location?

<Aside type="tip" title="UTagActorComponent"> 
Every Actor has a `Tags` Section in their properties. This is where tags can be added. These are text by default so, error prone.

FlowPilot includes a <LinkRef c="UTagActorComponent" /> component to make adding Tags to actors easy. 
</Aside>

## Wrapping Up

You should now have a basic understanding of how to create, edit, and run FlowPilot. 
We covered how to create an asset, linking the asset to a <LinkRef c="UFlowPilotComponent" />, spawn actors in game, and use GameplayTags to find Actors.
These constitute the barebones of FlowPilot.

Happy game developing!
