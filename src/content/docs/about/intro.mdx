## Description

FlowPilot is an Unreal Engine code plugin that allows simple, modular and extensible gameplay flow creation. 
Using a data driven approach you can create gameplay very easily by re-using existing Tasks or FlowPilot Assets entirely. 
Provided with a custom FlowPilotEditor, making new sequences, interactive objects or scripted scenes is a breeze!
